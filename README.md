# Umbrella?
Umbrella? is a simple web app that lets you know if you should take your umbrella today. Allow access to your location and get the forecast. *This webapp was submitted as the final project for [CS50x](https://www.edx.org/es/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x).*

## Set up
Umbrella? is written in PHP and uses [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api). To user your OpenWeatherMap API key, create a new file in root called `apikey.php` and add the following line, replacing the key accordingly:

~~~
<?php $api_key = 'your OpenWeatherMap API key'; ?>
~~~
